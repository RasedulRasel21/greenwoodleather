You recognize a product that is currently not in stock by the button Send me an email as soon as it is available. You may leave your email address and as soon as the product is back in stock in our warehouse, you will be notified. It is difficult for us to say how long this can take: it can be four weeks, but it can also take longer. Do you need the product in the short term?

            "answer": "<p>It is of course possible that your leather bag will be in the rain. In general, leather resists water fairly well, but we do not guarantee that our bags are 100% waterproof. A short shower should absolutely not be a problem (provided that all zippers are closed properly). When the bag is exposed to moisture for a long time, it may seep into the inside of the bag. Again, we are talking about long-term exposure here.</p><p>If you properly maintain your bag with our <a href=\"https://www.greenwoodleather.com.au/collections/leather-care\" title=\"Leather Care\">leather wax </a>(click), you will most likely be able to avoid these problems.</p><p>We recommend treating the leather of your bag 4 times per year with neutral leather wax. The leather wax will keep the leather hydrated and healthy. Your bag will look like new for a longtime.</p>"

            "answer": "<p>The leather used for our products mostly comes from Australia, Argentina, Brazil, and India. Our main factory is located in India. We have a wonderful working relationship with our manufacturer. Our values align and we share a common goal to produce the best quality bags for fair prices. This factory is built in a green environment where there are good living conditions for the employees.<br/><br/>Our aim is to offer you well thought-out, well-made products at a fair price, all year round.</p>"
